# Sample AWS API Gateway Lambda Authorizer
A lambda authorizer provides custom authorization for API Endpoints exposed through Amazon API Gateway. This authorizer makes sure that API requests:
* Contain a Bearer token (JWT) generated by your [Custom Authorization Server](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/-/create-authz-server/)
* And the "uid" (user id claim) in the JWT matches the API request {userid} parameter. This ensures that users can only update their own profile and settings.

## Dependencies
We use the library [Okta JWT Verifier for Node.js](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/jwt-verifier) validate the token. And upon validation generate the [aws-auth-policy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-auth-policy) for Amazon API Gateway.

# Deployment

## Step 1. Build
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into the main directory
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run zip` will create a source bundle and place it in the `\dist` folder. You will need this zip file in the next steps, below.

## Step 2. Create Lambda function using the AWS Lambda Console/UI
1. Click **Create Function**
2. Select **Author from scratch**
3. Provide a value for **Function name**
4. Runtime = **Node.js 10.x**
5. Click **Create Function** (This will automatically create an AMI role. But you can also select an existing one with the correct permissions if you have one)
6. In the **Code entry type** field, select **Upload a .zip file** and upload the previously generated zip file
7. Add **Environment variables**:
| NAME | VALUE |
| ---- | ----- |
|AUD|`api://default` *(or whichever value you configured as "Audience" in your AuthorizationServer)*|
|CLIENT_ID|*(the client_id of your application configured in Okta)*|
|ISSUER|The *"issuer"* value of your AuthorizationServer (e.g. `https://acme.okta.com/oauth2/default`)|

## Step 3. 
Create an Authorizer for your API (Amazon API Gateway) using this Lambda function
